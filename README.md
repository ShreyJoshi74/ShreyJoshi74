## 👨‍💻 Professional Profile

I am a software engineer focused on building scalable, distributed systems and integrating intelligent AI workflows into modern applications. With a strong foundation in **Java/Spring** and **React**, I bridge the gap between robust backend architecture and intuitive user experiences. 

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in **Generative AI orchestration** and **cloud-native microservices**, focusing on how LLMs can be leveraged within enterprise-grade Java ecosystems.

- 🛠️ **Current Focus:** Optimizing RAG pipelines using Spring AI and LangGraph.
- 🧠 **Philosophy:** Writing clean, maintainable code and solving complex problems through data structures and algorithmic efficiency.
- 📈 **Goal:** Contributing to high-impact products while maintaining a disciplined "learning in public" workflow.
